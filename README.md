# ES IPGeo Ingest Processor

This repository contains the `es-ipgeo-ingest-processor.zip`, an Elasticsearch ingest processor plugin designed to enrich documents containing an IP address with geolocation, currency, security, and timezone data using the ipgeolocation.io databases. Depending on the type of ipgeolocation.io database you are using, you can access various types of data such as country, city, latitude, longitude, timezone, currency information, and security details.

The enriched documents can then be used for visualization in Kibana, providing a powerful way to analyze and display geospatial data. The processor can also be integrated with Logstash to enrich real-time logs, index them into Elasticsearch, and then visualize the data in Kibana. This repository contains all the instructions and examples for installation and usage with Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana.

For more information on available databases, visit [ipgeolocation.io databases information](https://ipgeolocation.io/db-pricing.html).

## Features

- **Geolocation Enrichment**: Automatically enriches documents with detailed geolocation data such as country, city, latitude, longitude and much more.
- **Currency Information**: Adds currency data based on the IP address location.
- **Security Details**: Includes security-related information such as whether the IP is a known attacker, proxy, or belongs to a cloud provider.
- **Timezone Data**: Provides timezone information for the IP address, including the current time and offset.

## Additional Details

### Data Enrichment Capabilities

The IPGeo Ingest Processor leverages the powerful databases from ipgeolocation.io to provide extensive data enrichment capabilities. This includes:

- **Country and City Information**: Adds precise location details based on the IP address.
- **ISP and Organization Data**: Provides information about the internet service provider and organization associated with the IP address.
- **Security Threat Analysis**: Identifies potential security threats by checking if the IP address is known for malicious activities.
- **Customizable Fields**: Allows users to specify which fields to include or exclude from the enrichment process, providing flexibility based on specific use cases.

### Benefits of Using IPGeo Ingest Processor

- **Enhanced Analytics**: By enriching your documents with geolocation data, you can perform more detailed and meaningful analysis.
- **Improved Decision Making**: Visualizing geospatial data helps in making informed decisions based on the geographic distribution of your data.
- **Real-Time Insights**: Integrating with Logstash enables real-time log enrichment, allowing you to monitor and respond to events as they happen.
- **Comprehensive Visualization**: Using Kibana, you can create powerful visualizations and dashboards to track and analyze geospatial data effectively.

### Practical Use Cases

- **Network Security Monitoring**: Identify and respond to suspicious activities by analyzing the geographic origin of network traffic.
- **Sales and Marketing Analysis**: Understand the geographic distribution of your customers and tailor marketing strategies accordingly.
- **Logistics and Fleet Management**: Track the real-time location of vehicles and optimize routes for efficiency.
